# Webhook Client â€“ Bajaj Task

This is a Spring Boot application that *runs automatically on startup*.  
It connects to the Bajaj generateWebhook endpoint, retrieves a webhook URL and access token, determines which SQL question to solve based on regNo, and submits the solution query to the webhook.

## ðŸš€ How it works

1. On startup, the app:
   - Reads your details (name, regNo, email) from application.properties.
   - Calls generateWebhook API.
   - Gets back a webhook URL and accessToken.
   - Decides which SQL query to use:
     - **Odd last 2 digits of regNo â†’ Question 1**
     - *Even last 2 digits â†’ Question 2*
   - Saves the query to final-query.sql.
   - Submits the query to the returned webhook with Authorization header.
